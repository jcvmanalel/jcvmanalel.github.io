	<p>We are at war. But the outcome is certain. We are not fighting for victory...we’re fighting from victory. When He died on the cross and was raised from the dead, Jesus Christ defeated sin and de-fanged death, crushing our enemy, Satan. We still battle, but victory is an accomplished act. Jesus did that.</p>
	<p>This war from victory is a different kind of war, is it not? It’s like the war Joshua was asked to fight, claiming the occupied Promised Land that God had already given. “The land is yours,” God told him. “You own it, and My word is the title deed. I promised it to Abraham; I will give it to you. But you must fight.” He led the nation of Israel in some fierce battles, but Joshua owned the dirt everywhere he put his foot down. He had the deed. He was fighting not for victory against the Amalekites, the Amorites and others—he was fighting from victory already made certain by God Himself.</p>
	<p>That’s how we are. Our battles are not against flesh and blood, but they are very real just the same. We go head to head against the wiles of Satan, but we are fighting from victory, because God has already accomplished it. When Jesus endured the cross and conquered the grave, we became soldiers whose ultimate conquest is assured.</p>

                        <h3>“Each time he said, “My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.” 2 Corinthians 12:9 (NLT)</h3>
                        <span class="meta">Posted by <a href="#">Mary Pinckney</a> on  June 24, 2016</span>
                    <p>Stop running! Don’t you know who you are?  You are a child of the Most High God. You are more than a conqueror! You were born to win! Instead of throwing in the towel every time you are challenged, it is time to step up to the plate and defeat what has been defeating you.</p>

                    <p>As believers, I believe we often forget that the power of God has been made available to us in our daily lives.  Much like Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:9-10, we try to avoid dealing with challenges that come our way.  When we are not avoiding them, we try to play God in our own lives and do it all in our own strength.</p>
                    <p><b>Our salvation is not based on our works, but on our believing!</b>  It is all through faith.  Remember upon the finished work of the cross, the Grace and Power of God was made available to you and me as we accepted the sacrifice of Jesus.  <b> IT IS FINISHED!</b>  When He uttered those 3 words on the cross it gave us access to that Grace and Power. What good news!</p>

                    <p>Again, we find Paul asking God each time to take away his weaknesses, his frailties, his mess-ups, only for God to respond; <i>“My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.”</i> This would have angered many of us. We want to be free instantly.</p>

                    <p>Take a look at <b>Titus 2:11-12</b> (AMP) “For the grace of God (His unmerited favor and blessing) has come forward (appeared) for the deliverance from sin and the eternal salvation for all mankind. 12 It has trained us to reject and renounce all ungodliness and worldly (passionate) desires, to live discreet (temperate, self-controlled), upright, devout (spiritually whole) lives in this present world.”  His Grace is Power!  It instructs us, equips us and empowers us</p>

                    <p>It is by the grace of God that we are destined to conquer, destined to win. It is not by our own might, nor by our own power, but by the Spirit of Almighty God.  Take a lesson from Paul today and be a winner! From this point on, learn to boast in your weaknesses and allow His Grace and Power to be manifested in your life.</p>

                    <blockquote>Father, forgive us for running from our challenges. I pray that we will begin to face every obstacle head on knowing and trusting that you have already equipped us with the Grace and Power needed to overcome every obstacle in Jesus Mighty Name Amen.</blockquote>

					<span class="meta">Posted by <a href="#">Joseph Prince</a> on  July 18, 2016</span>

                    <p><b>Mark 8:29</b> :
					He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered and said to Him, “You are the Christ.”</p>
					<p>Do you know that how you see Jesus determines what you receive from Him? If you see Jesus as your healer, you will receive healing. If you see Jesus as your refuge and fortress, you will receive protection.</p>
					<p>he people of Nazareth, Jesus’ hometown, saw Jesus in the natural. They said of Him, “Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Judas? And His sisters, are they not all with us?” (Matthew 13:55–56) They saw Jesus in the natural. 
					They did not see Him as God in the flesh. As a result, He could not do many mighty works there. (Matthew 13:58)</p>
					<p>Today, many people, including some philosophers, see Jesus of Nazareth as a good person who led an exemplary life. 
					They feel that if all of us could live our lives like Him, the world would be a better place.</p>
					<p>They don’t see Jesus as the bread of God who came from heaven to give life to the world. (John 6:33) They don’t see Him as the one who came to give them living water, so that they would never thirst again. (John 4:14) They don’t see Him as the Lamb of God, who took away the sin of the world. 
					(John 1:29) They don’t receive from Him what they need because they don’t esteem Him rightly.</p>
					<p>Jesus did not come just to set a good example for man to follow. He came to be our Redeemer. (Galatians 3:13) He came to be our righteousness. (1 Corinthians 1:30) He came to be our shepherd, so that we will not lack anything. (Psalm 23:1)</p>
					<p>Jesus asked His disciples once, “But who do you say that I am?” How you answer this question depends on how you see Jesus. And how you see Jesus will determine how and what you receive from Him. So see Him as your God, as everything He claims to be in His Word, and He will do mighty works in your life!</p>
